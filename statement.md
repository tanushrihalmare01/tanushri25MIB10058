# 📄 Project Statement  
## Library Management System – Python & SQLite

### 1. Problem Definition  
It takes a lot of time and is prone to mistakes to manually manage books, members, and issuing procedures in a library. A straightforward digital solution that can safely store documents, update them fast, and oversee a library's general operations is required.

---

### 2. Objective  
To develop a fully functional **Library Management System** using Python and SQLite that can:
- Maintain a catalog of books  
- Store member information  
- Track issued and returned books  
- Automate record handling  

---

### 3. Scope of Project  
The system covers the following operations:
- Book registration  
- Member registration  
- Issuing of books  
- Returning of books  
- Database storage and retrieval  
- Command-line-based interface  

This project is suitable for small libraries, schools, colleges, or learning purposes.

### 4. Methodology  
- Use **Python** for processing and user interaction  
- Use **SQLite** for database storage  
- Implement functions for CRUD operations  
- Create modular code using multiple Python files  
- Ensure data integrity and error handling  

---

### 5. Expected Output  
A working software that allows the librarian/user to:
- Add, update, delete, search books  
- Add, update, delete members  
- Issue and return books with date logs  
- View complete database information  

---

### 6. Conclusion  
The Library Management System simplifies the entire library workflow.  
It makes data management efficient, fast, and error-free.  
Using Python + SQLite ensures reliability, portability, and ease of use.
